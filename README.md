Experiences and Strengths: Explain how this course will help you in reaching your professional goals.
- What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

In this course, I have learned basic cloud computing terminology and have put cloud computing into practice using Amazon Web Services. 
- Describe your strengths as a software developer.

My strengths as a software developer are my problem-solving skills and my ability to find the most efficient path to a solution.
- Identify the types of roles you are prepared to assume in a new job.

I am prepared to assume the role of engineer. I feel confident in my ability to find the solution to any assignment that is placed in front of me. Should I be working with creating web applications, deploying them on the cloud, or a combination of the two, I feel I have the ability to be a worthwhile asset to a software development/engineering team.

Planning for Growth: Synthesize the knowledge you have gathered about cloud services.
- Identify various ways that microservices or serverless may be used to produce efficiencies of management and scale in your web application in the future. Consider the following:
  - How would you handle scale and error handling?
    
    The best part of serverless or microservice is the automatic handling of scale. Error handling can be tougher in serverless however and you must use the tools provided in the AWS suite to troubleshoot. The best way to avoid errors is by writing sound code. 
  - How would you predict the cost?
    
    You can use an average user count to predict the cost of serverless due to it Pay-To-Use model. Makes hosting your website more like a utility which can help make predictions more accurate. 
  - What is more cost predictable, containers or serverless?
    
    Containers can be more cost predictable as you set the run time and know exactly how much traffic you will be able to support. The issue is that you can have additional waste or customer dissatisfaction caused by over or under-producing computational power. 
- Explain several pros and cons that would be deciding factors in plans for expansion.
  
  When planning to expand you must ask yourself, is serverless going to be enough? If you are not needing to do complex data handling and can work within the confines of a cloud servicer than the answer is probably yes. 
- What roles do elasticity and pay-for-service play in decision making for planned future growth?
  
  This feeds into the above question the answer is yes because it is far more cost-effective to deploy onto serverless high elasticity services. The high elasticity means future-proofing, but it also means savings when your services are not in use.
